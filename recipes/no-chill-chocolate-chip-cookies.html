        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>These no-chill chocolate chip cookies come together so fast and are absolutely delicious! They're the perfect way to quickly and easily satisfy your cookie craving. These cookies are made with melted butter, so they spread out quite a bit as they bake. I love this because it gives them chewy, golden-brown edges and soft centers.</p>

                        <li>1 tsp cornstarch (3g)</li>
                        <li>1/2 tsp baking soda (3g)</li>
                        <li>1/4 tsp fine salt (1g)</li>
                        <li>2/3 cup packed light brown sugar (133g)</li>
                        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar (50g)</li>
                        <li>1 large egg, room temperature (56g)</li>
                        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract (4ml)</li>
                        <li>1 cup milk or dark chocolate chips (175g)</li>

                    </ul>

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Start by melting 1/2 cup of unsalted butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat it in 15-second intervals until it's melted, then set aside. I like to let my butter sit for about 10 minutes once it's melted to let it cool down a bit. This makes the dough easier to scoop and helps the cookies spread less while they bake.</li>
                        <li>While the butter cools, preheat your oven to 350 F / 175 C and line two large baking sheets with silicone mats or parchment paper.</li>
                        <li>Whisk together 1 1/3 cups flour, 1 tsp cornstarch, 1/2 tsp baking soda, and 1/4 tsp salt in a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
                        <li>Pour the melted and cooled butter, 2/3 cup packed brown sugar, and 1/4 cup granulated sugar into a large bowl. Whisk the ingredients together by hand for about a minute, until the mixture is smooth, and no lumps remain. It should become lighter in color as it's whisked.</li>
                        <li>Whisk in 1 large egg and 1 tsp vanilla extract. Stir until the egg is fully incorporated.</li>
                        <li>Pour the dry ingredients into the butter/sugar mixture and stir together with a wooden spoon or spatula. Mix until no visible streaks of flour remain. The dough will be soft/sticky, but that's how it's supposed to be!</li>
                        <li>Mix in 1 cup of chocolate chips or chunks of your choice.</li>
                        <li>Use a spoon or cookie scoop to shape 1 1/2 Tbsp cookie dough balls and place them 2-3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. They need a lot of space because they spread quite a bit while they bake!</li>
                        <li>Bake both trays of cookies together for 11-13 minutes, and rotate the pans halfway through to help them bake evenly. The cookies are ready when the edges just start to brown but the centers still look slightly under-baked. The cookies will continue to bake on the sheet and firm up once removed from the oven, so it's always best to err on the side of under-baked!</li>
                        <li>Place the cookie sheet on a wire rack and let the cookies cool fully on the pan. I like to press a few extra chocolate chips on top of each cookie while they're still warm and add a garnish of flaky sea salt.</li>
                        <li>Enjoy warm with a glass of milk, or store fully cooled cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.</li>
